# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-and-Visualization
Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about Netflix movies. I've cleaned the data by removing missing values and explored it using Python and R. Below, you'll find details on how to set up the project, insights from data exploration, and visualizations.

Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository: begin with cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Dependencies:
   - For Python: Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).
   - For R: Install R and ggplot2 package.
3. Run the Code: Follow the instructions in the project files to run the data cleaning and exploration scripts.

Data Cleaning and Exploration
- I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values.
- During exploration, I looked at genres, release years, and other relevant features.

Visualizations
- I used Python (matplotlib and seaborn) and R (ggplot) to create visualizations.
- Sample visualizations are included in the project.

Hypothesis Testing
- I performed T-statistics hypothesis testing (details in the code).

Usage
- Access the cleaned dataset or explore the visualizations to gain insights.
